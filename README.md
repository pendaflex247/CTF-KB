This collection of tools and methods within this repository have been utilized by me for CTF competitions throughout the years.

TOOLS & DOMAINS

[CTF Tools](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/CTF%20Tools/README.md)


[Open Source Intelligence](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Open%20Source%20Intelligence/README.md)

    Open Source Intelligence is the process of gathering publicly available information from sources such 
    as social media, search engines, and public repositories to gain comprehensive knowledge on a specific 
    subject or target.

[Cryptography](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Cryptography/README.md)

    Cryptography deals with identifying encryption techniques used to secure messages and using tools 
    to extract plain text.

[Password Cracking](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Password%20Cracking/README.md)

    Password cracking involves identifying different types of password hashes and using various techniques 
    to determine plain text passwords efficiently. 

[Log Analysis](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Log%20Analysis/README.md)

    Log Analysis requires using proper tools and techniques to establish a normal baseline and detect any 
    malicious activities by examining log files from various services.

[Network Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Network%20Traffic%20Analysis/README.md)

    Network Traffic Analysis involves identifying both malicious and benign network traffic to demonstrate 
    knowledge of potential security breaches.

[Forensics](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Forensics/README.md)

    Forensics involves analyzing, processing, recovering, and/or investigating digital evidence related to 
    computer incidents.


[Scanning & Reconnaissance](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Scanning%20%26%20Reconnaissance/README.md)

    Scanning & Reconnaissance is about finding and utilizing the right tools to collect information on a target, 
    such as its services and possible weaknesses.

[Enumeration & Exploitation](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Enumeration%20%26%20Exploitation)

    Web Application Exploitation is the act of discovering and using exploitable vulnerabilities to bypass security 
    measures in online services.

[Web Application Exploitation](https://github.com/pendaflex247/CTF-KB/tree/main/Web%20Application%20Exploitation)

    Enumeration & Exploitation involves identifying actionable vulnerabilities and exploits and utilizing them to 
    bypass security measures in code and compiled binaries.
