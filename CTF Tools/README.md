### Recommendation for improving CTF Skills

Here are many free online ctfs you can join (just note: they are much harder than NCL) that many great cybersecurity professionals play on. I used to always play them, get close to last place, and read all their writeups afterward. I will link a few resources that helped me with general ctf practice and some for specific categories that NCL has. Best of luck for this season.
	
- https://ctftime.org/ - has a list of awesome CTFs almost every weekend. Some are very very hard to even do 1 problem others are a bit easier. 
	
- https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflow - has many awesome videos on security problems and CTFs. He has a video series that explains many binary exploitation problems 
	
- https://www.hackthebox.com/ - has a ton of boxes to learn about vulnerabilities and privilege escalation. This one is not too related to NCL-type of questions but the problem-solving skills from this one translate really well into NCL and pen testing if you're going into that.  
	
- https://picoctf.org/ - This is another CTF website but they host a gym that has a lot of problems that you can do anytime!  In terms of notes: here's one of my friends made before he graduated: 
	
- https://github.com/deviningers/ncl-notes it has a list of tools and things to try out during NCL. Mainly NCL comes down to practice and some pattern recognition. Do a lot of googling on a problem and make sure you learn as much as you can. Also, make sure to have fun!
